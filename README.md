# **Mathematical framework for memorization to generalization transition in diffusion-based generative models**
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results obtained by Indranil Halder and Cengiz Pehlevan in [arxiv: ](https://arxiv.org). 

## Experiments

The experiments on the linear diffusion model are run using `LDM.py`. The U-Net-based non-linear diffusion model with attention layers is defined in `model.py`, and `modules.py`. Simulations with it can be performed using `simulation.py`.

## Dependencies

We use Python 3.10.12, and dependencies with their exact
version numbers listed in `environment.yml`.
